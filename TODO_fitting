Have:

OM integrates vector equations per timestep
NC's code duplicates as an independent system of equations

Want Nv0 / Lambda

Fit: minimise Upsilon*x + Lambda - x
Loss function: ||S_v - S_vT ||^2


Option 1
----------

Decouple OM's vector equations from the human pop & timestep and use to drive a
simple fitting cycle for Nv0.

Advantages: less code duplication, less complex(?)

Requires: providing Kvi and αi in some form


Option 2
------------

Decouple OM_s vector equations and use to find a root of f(x) = Upsilon x + Lambda - x
(in matrix form or otherwise).

Advantages: explicit solution
Disadvantages: matrix form is complex and possibly slow to calculate with;
doing so otherwise may be difficult.

Requires: providing Kvi and αi in some form


Option 3
--------------

Reuse NC's code to calculate Nv0

Requires: providing Kvi and αi
