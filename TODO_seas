Initialising seasonality:

1) maybe adjust input EIR by clamping to some minimum?
2) initial human warmup
3) record human infectiousness over 5 years from forced EIR
4) run just the vector model using this human infectiousness; fit output
5) switch to dynamic mode and run for 5 years; if resulting EIR is not close to required, abort
6) run main sim

Emergence: use K + exp(fourier(FC))
Fit: start with K=0 and one coefficient
While not close to required output, add two coefficients and try fitting all parameters
(up to some maximum number of coefficients)
